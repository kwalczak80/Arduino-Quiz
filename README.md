# **Design**
   <ul>
      <li><strong>Typography</strong></li>
      <ul>
         <li>I visited the <a href="https://fonts.google.com/">Google fonts </a> website to explore available font options for my project. After consideration, three different font types were chosen to be used in different sections of the website.</li>
         <li>The <a href="https://fonts.google.com/?query=teko">Teko</a> font is used to display the quiz name.</li>
         <li>The <a href="https://fonts.google.com/?query=Roboto+Condensed+">Roboto Condensed</a> font is used to display the quiz questions.</li>
         <li>The <a href="https://fonts.google.com/?query=Roboto">Roboto</a> font is used to display all other text information.</li>
         <li>All the fonts mentioned above were imported from the official Google fonts website.</li>
      </ul>
   </ul>
 <ul>
      <li><strong>Background</strong></li>
      <ul>
         <li>I initially intended to use a picture as the background for the page. Nevertheless, since the quiz is about electronic devices, I dropped this idea as I wanted to have a more attractive website. Thus, I decided to implement an animated background that is more relevant to the website's topic. After doing some research, I found an interesting video showing some sort of motherboard electronic circuit with animated blue lines indicating the flow of electric current. Since this video is aligned with the website topic and at the same time does not distract the user from other parts of the website, I decided to use it as a looped video background for the website.</li>
      </ul>
</ul>
