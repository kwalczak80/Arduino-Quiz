</ul>
<hr>

# **Design**
<h2>Typography</h2>
<ul>
  <li>I visited the <a href="https://fonts.google.com/">Google fonts </a> website to explore available font options for my project. After consideration, three different font types were chosen to be used in different sections of the website.</li>
  <li>The <a href="https://fonts.google.com/?query=teko">Teko</a> font is used to display the quiz name.</li>
  <li>The <a href="https://fonts.google.com/?query=Roboto+Condensed+">Roboto Condensed</a> font is used to display the quiz questions.</li>
  <li>The <a href="https://fonts.google.com/?query=Roboto">Roboto</a> font is used to display all other text information.</li>
  <li>All the fonts mentioned above were imported from the official Google fonts website.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Background</h2>
<ul>
  <li>I initially intended to use a picture as the background for the page. Nevertheless, since the quiz is about electronic devices, I dropped this idea as I wanted to have a more attractive website. Thus, I decided to implement an animated background that is more relevant to the website's topic. After doing some research, I found an interesting video showing some sort of motherboard electronic circuit with animated blue lines indicating the flow of electric current. Since this video is aligned with the website topic and at the same time does not distract the user from other parts of the website, I decided to use it as a looped video background for the website.</li>
</ul>

![Background](docs/screenshots/background-screenshot.png "Background")
<h2>Gradient</h2>
<ul>
  <li>I used the <a href="https://cssgradient.io/">CSS gradient</a> website to create a gradient background for my project. This gradient is used as a background for the quiz information being displayed on the page.
    The contrast checker was used to make sure that the contrast is sufficient and that there are no issues with the website readability.
  </li>
</ul>

![Gradient background](docs/screenshots/gradient.png "Gradient Background")
<h2>Colour Scheme</h2>

![Scheme colours](docs/screenshots/main-website-colors.png "Main website colors")
<ul>
  <li>I used <a href="https://coolors.co/">Coolors</a> to come up with a color scheme and then the <a href="https://coolors.co/contrast-checker/1e1e1e-6ab6f3">contrast checker</a> to make sure that the contrast is sufficient and there are no issues with website readability.</li>
  <ul>
  <li>#1E1E1E – color was used for all the text information being displayed on the website. A contrast checker was also used in this case to make sure that the text and background colors do not create issues with website readability.</li>
  <li>#17608A - color was used as a background for all the buttons used on the website.</li>
  <li>#F7F7F7 - color was used to display the text information on the buttons.</li>
  <li>#088308 - color was used to display the number of correctly answered questions.</li>
  <li>#D10F0F - color was used to display the number of incorrectly answered questions.</li>
  <li>#CECFE27E - color was used as a background for the player name input field.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>

# **Site Structure**
<p>This website is designed to be a one-page site. Based on the user activity, relevant sections of the website are being shown or hidden. This is done when the user clicks on the button in order to proceed through the quiz. To start the quiz user must first enter their name which will be then populated on the welcome screen where the rules of the quiz are displayed. Once the user is familiar with the rules, they can hit the “I understand. Let’s play” button to start the quiz. Questions are presented one by one with the current question number shown on the screen. In order to move to the next question, the current question must be answered. The scoring area helps the user to track which questions were answered correctly and which were not. Upon completion of the quiz, a summary of correctly answered questions is displayed on the screen. At this point, the user has two choices; to do the quiz again by clicking on the <strong>Try again</strong> button or to visit the Arduino official website by clicking on the Arduino icon. This will open the Arduino official website in a new tab.</p>

# **Testing User Stories from the User Experience (UX) Section**
<h3>As a user, I would like to play this quiz regardless of the device screen size I'm using.</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Plan</strong></li>
  <p>The main goal I had when planning this project was that the Arduino quiz website would work on a variety of devices, starting with mobile phones and ending with large screens of desktop computers.</p>
  <li><strong>Implementation</strong></li>
  <p>When creating this quiz, the main idea was to create a website that would be correctly displayed on any mobile phone screen size. Once that was achieved, I focused on higher resolution devices next. The intended goals were achieved thanks to the use of appropriate tools, simulating the display of a website on various devices, and the appropriate configuration of media inquiries.</p>
  <li><strong>Testing</strong></li>
  <p>The Arduino quiz website was tested using the tools listed below.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/">Chrome Dev Tools</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://ami.responsivedesign.is">Am I Responsive?</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://responsivedesignchecker.com">Responsive Website Design Checker</a>
  </ul>
  <li><strong>Result</strong></li>
  <p>After performing many tests, I confirm that the assumptions contained in the initial plan have been achieved.</p>
  <li><strong>Verdict</strong></li>
  <p>The Arduino Quiz website allows the user to display its content on a wide variety of screen sizes, including mobile phones, tablets, laptops, and desktops. The layout of the page can change depending on the display resolution.</p>
</ul>
<h3>As a user, I would like to easily understand the quiz rules.</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Plan</strong></li>
  <p>As my project is in the form of a quiz, I wanted to make sure that the user fully understands the quiz rules that will apply before it starts.</p>
  <li><strong>Implementation</strong></li>
  <p>The rules of the quiz were formulated as simply as possible so they would be understandable by everyone. The rules are presented as a 6-point list.
  <p>These rules are displayed each time when the quiz starts.</p>
  <li><strong>Testing</strong></li>
  <p>After creating the rules for the quiz, I decided to ask my friends to check if they were clear and understandable so that there was no doubt about their meaning.</p>
  <li><strong>Result</strong></li>
  <p>The opinions received from people checking the rules of the quiz were very positive, so I believe that the user is fully informed about the course of the quiz.</p>
  <li><strong>Verdict</strong></li>
  <p>The Quiz rules are explained well in a clear and understandable format.</p>
</ul>
<h3>As a user, I would like to track the quiz progress.</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Plan</strong></li>
  <p>Show the user how many questions have been answered correctly or incorrectly, and which question number is currently displayed.</p>
  <li><strong>Implementation</strong></li>
  <p>To quickly check the quiz progress, I decided to add a scoring area below the currently displayed question. This section displays information on how many questions have been answered correctly (highlighted in green) or incorrectly (highlighted in red). This section is automatically updated after each answered question. Depending on the screen resolution, the scoring area can be displayed horizontally or vertically.
    Above the section displaying the question, I also decided to add a section that displays the number of the currently displayed question so that the user knows how many questions are left until the end of the quiz.
  </p>
  <li><strong>Testing</strong></li>
  <p>The sections listed above have been tested many times to make sure that the information displayed is correct. No errors have been noted.</p>
  <li><strong>Result</strong></li>
  <p>The quiz progress sections are working as planned and provide relevant information about the quiz progress.</p>
  <li><strong>Verdict</strong></li>
  <p>In the scoring area, the user is provided with a breakdown of correct and incorrect answers. Above the question displayed on the screen, the user can also find the number of questions they have answered so far.</p>
</ul>
<h3>As a user, I would like to know when the quiz is complete.</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Plan</strong></li>
  <p> Show the information with a quiz summary to the user</p>
  <li><strong>Implementation</strong></li>
  <p>Once the user has answered all the questions, a new section will be displayed on the screen. In this section, the user will be informed that the quiz is over and how many questions have been answered correctly.</p>
  <li><strong>Testing</strong></li>
  <p>Tests have been conducted numerous times to ensure that the information displayed is accurate. </p>
  <li><strong>Result</strong></li>
  <p>The quiz summary section is working as planned.</p>
  <li><strong>Verdict</strong></li>
  <p>Upon entering the quiz, the user is informed that there are ten questions to be answered. Once all ten questions are answered, the quiz summary section is displayed, with information on how many questions the user answered correctly.</p>
</ul>
<h3>As a user, I would like to have a chance to retake the quiz to improve my score.</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Plan</strong></li>
  <p>If the user wants to improve their scores, provide them an option to retake the quiz.</p>
  <li><strong>Implementation</strong></li>
  <p>I chose to include a "Try again" button in the summary quiz area to allow users to retry the quiz.</p>
  <li><strong>Testing</strong></li>
  <p>The "Try again" button has been tested many times to verify that a new quiz is loaded each time when the button is clicked.</p>
  <li><strong>Result</strong></li>
  <p>The implemented “try again” button is working correctly and initiates a new quiz each time when clicked.</p>
  <li><strong>Verdict</strong></li>
  <p>If the user wishes to improve their score, they have the option to try again.</p>
</ul>
<h3>As a user, I would like to visit the official Arduino website where I can find information regarding the questions asked in the quiz.</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Plan</strong></li>
  <p>If the user wants further information about the Arduino microcontroller, they should be able to go to the official Arduino website.</p>
  <li><strong>Implementation</strong></li>
  <p>I opted to include an icon with the Arduino symbol and written information in the quiz summary area, informing the user that clicking on the icon will take them to the official Arduino website.</p>
  <li><strong>Testing</strong></li>
  <p>Initial tests were not successful as the official Arduino website was not opening in a new tab. Following a thorough review of the HTML code, I discovered that the link closing tags were incorrectly placed, resulting in the page was not displayed in a new tab. The issue was solved, and subsequent tests confirmed that the Arduino website is now opening correctly.</p>
  <li><strong>Result</strong></li>
  <p>The tests confirmed that when the user clicks on the Arduino icon the official Arduino website will be displayed in a new tab.</p>
  <li><strong>Verdict</strong></li>
  <p>The user can visit the official Arduino website by clicking the Arduino icon at the end of the quiz to learn more about the microcontroller or find answers to the questions posed in the quiz.</p>
